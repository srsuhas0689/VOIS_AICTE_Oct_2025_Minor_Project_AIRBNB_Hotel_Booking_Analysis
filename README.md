The Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis Project focuses on predicting the price of Airbnb listings using machine learning techniques. Accurate pricing is essential for hosts to maximize occupancy and profits while ensuring fair prices for travelers. The project uses historical Airbnb data to train a regression model that identifies relationships between listing features—such as bedrooms, bathrooms, cleanliness, and guest reviews—and their corresponding prices.

The system is developed using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within Google Colab for implementation and visualization. It provides valuable insights for hosts, travelers, platform analysts, and researchers, enabling data-driven pricing decisions and improving the overall Airbnb experience.
